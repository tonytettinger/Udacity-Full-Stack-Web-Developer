# Udacity Full Stack Developer Nanodegree Projects

Udacity's Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree Project repository

#### Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree projects:

- [x] **Project 1** - Design a Venue Booking Database

The fictitious startup Fy-yur is building a website that facilitates bookings between artists who can play at venues, and venues who want to book artists. This site:

- Lets venue managers and artists sign up, fill out their information, and list their availability for shows.
- Lets artists browse venues where they can play, and see what past/upcoming artists have been
  booked at a venue.
- Lets a venue manager browse artists that would like to play in their city, and see what past/upcoming
  venues where the artist has played/will be playing.
  The goal of this project is to build out the data models for this booking application.

- [x] **Project 2** - Trivia API

Build a Trivia API. The API will allow users to:

- Search for trivia questions and answers via category and difficulty

- Allow public users to view drink names and graphics.
- Allow the shop baristas to see the recipe information.
- Allow the shop managers to create new drinks and edit existing drinks.
