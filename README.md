#### Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree projects:

- [] **Project 1** - Design a Venue Booking Database

The fictitious startup Fy-yur is building a website that facilitates bookings between artists who can play at venues, and venues who want to book artists. This site:
  - Lets venue managers and artists sign up, fill out their information, and list their availability for shows.
  - Lets artists browse venues where they can play, and see what past/upcoming artists have been
  booked at a venue.
  - Lets a venue manager browse artists that would like to play in their city, and see what past/upcoming
  venues where the artist has played/will be playing.
  The goal of this project is to build out the data models for this booking application.
