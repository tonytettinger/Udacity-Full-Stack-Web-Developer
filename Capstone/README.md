# Udacity Full Stack Developer Nanodegree Capstone Project

## Motivation

Create a back-end application which demonstrates the functinality of endpoints with Role Based Access tests.
To implement that JWT authentication has been included in the project and current JWT's has been provided for testing.
The motivation for this project is to demonstrate skills in combining the use of authorization tools, RBAC endpoints, error handling, test writing and handling data between the front and back-end of the application.

- Coding standards: PEP8 compliant code
- Authorization: RBAC roles and JWT is implemented by the 3rd party Auth0.
- Testing: Comprehensive RBAC and error handling has been implemented as part of the test-driven development process.
- Documentation: Setup instructions and endpoints has been documented.
- Deployment: The final code is deployed on Heroku and tests can be run agains its database.

This project is for a movie agency which has movies and actors listed in its database. There are two roles, Casting Assistant and Casting Director. For viewing the list of movies and actors in the database the user shoul be logged with the Casting Assistant role. To add, delete and modify movies the role of the user has to be Casting Director.

## Setup and dependencies

This project is based on Python3, pip and psql. Please make sure these are pre-installed on your system.
To start the project create a virtual environment in the downloaded project folder with the following bash commands:

```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

Following this install the required packages, PIP dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

There are environment variables such as JWT codes and the database URL are stored in the setup.sh file.
Before running the test file execute:

```bash
source setup.sh
```

Following this the application endpoints are ready to be tested with the deployed server by running:

```bash
python3 test_app.py
```

The deployed application can be found here:

https://fsnd-model.herokuapp.com/

Note: If the existing JWT's are expired new ones could be obtained by following the link on the application homepage.
For the Casting Director JWT please log in with the following credentials:

email: a.tettinger@yahoo.com
password: GoUdacity123

For the Casting Assistant JWT:
email: antal.tettinger@clovio.com
password: GoUDacity123

You'll be redirected to the main page where the JWT can be copied from the URL after the # part.
Paste the JWT into the setup.sh into the CA_TOKEN and CD_TOKEN variables accordingly.

##### Key Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM we'll use handle the lightweight sqlite database. You'll primarily work in app.py and can reference models.py.

- [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is the extension we'll use to handle cross origin requests from our frontend server.
